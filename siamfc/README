Dependencies
============

We use MatConvNet v1.0beta24 (included).
MatConvNet depends on CUDA and cudnn for speed.
We used CUDA 8.0 and cudnn 5.1.

Installation
============

The process to build MatConvNet is contained in install.sh.
If you already have an operational version of MatConvNet installed,
you can alternatively modify `matconvnet_dir` in cfnet/src/tracking/startup.m.

We assume that CUDA is installed in the system libraries.

It is necessary to install (extract) cudnn in in matconvnet/local/cuda/.

CPU Mode
========

To run the tracker in CPU mode, uncomment the appropriate line in cfnet/src/tracking/run_baseline5_VOT.m.
To build MatConvNet without CUDA support, modify install.sh according to the comment in that file.
